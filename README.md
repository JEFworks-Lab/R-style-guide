# R Style Guide
### Best practices for readable, sharable, and verifiable R code

R is a high-level programming language used primarily for statistical computing and graphics. R does not have any well defined coding recommendations or de facto standards. This style guide provides some recommendations based on personal experience and expert opinions (see Additional Guides). Use your best judgement and common sense when deciding whether to adhere to these recommendations. Be consistent. Ultimately, a unified style will help make collaboration and sharing code easier.
