# R Style Guide
### Best practices for readable, sharable, and verifiable R code

R is a high-level programming language used primarily for statistical computing and graphics. R does not have any well defined coding recommendations nor is there a de facto standard. This style guide provides some recommendations based on personal experience and expert opinions (see Additional Guides and References). Use your best judgement and common sense when deciding to adhere or not adhere to these recommendations. Be consistent. Ultimately, a unified style will make collaboration and sharing code easier.
